# JavaDungeons

JavaDungeons is a Fabric mod that adds the custom blocks from Minecraft Dungeons into Minecraft: Java Edition. No textures are made by me, and they were obtained from Minecraft: Dungeons.

All blocks are named based on what I think they're closest to in Minecraft, unless they have a name in Dungeons or are just obvious as to what they are. Blocks are categorized under what category they're put under in the game files (so files tagged creeper woods will be put in the creeper woods category, etc.) I will not add a block if it's too close to vanilla. (so if there is very slight color variation from vanilla, I probably won't add it)
